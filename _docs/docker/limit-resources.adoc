== Spegnere il processo matto

wsl --shutdown

--

create a .wslconfig file in the Windows home directory (C:\Users\<Your Account Name>).
(Forse c'Ã¨ gia)

Input the contents of the file as follows:

----
[wsl2]
memory=1GB
processors=1
----

The memory and processors are the resources allocated to the wsl2 process. You can change the memory and processors according to your preference. This is my config on a 16GB i5 machine.

After that, restart the WSL2 process:-

Start PowerShell in admin mode and type: Restart-Service LxssManager

After that, you are good to go!

P.s.: Start docker only when it is required.
